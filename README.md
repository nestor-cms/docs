# Welcome

The Nested Component Based Content Management System (aka “Nestor”) is such a versatile system designed to allow a Site manager to rapidly build web content with multiple levels of access.  Nestor is based on the concept of combining Components into a nested structure referred to as a Recipe.   Each Component is responsible for a small task, such as access control, and when nested with other Components in a Recipe allows for cascading features and access control at any layer of the structure.   Put simply, Nestor is versatile content management system designed to support user generated content.

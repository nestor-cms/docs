    <h1>Configuration Files</h1> 
    <p>The Nestor configuration file - vce-config.php – is found in the root directory of your installation.  This file defines and assigns values to a variety of constants that will allow you to fine-tune the workings of your installation.</p>

   <h2> Installer Defined Settings</h2>
   <p> During installation, some key settings are written to the Nestor configuration file.   Many system issues can be caused by the wrong settings, so be careful about changing any of these key settings.</p>

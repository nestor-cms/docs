    <h1>Manage Components </h1>
    <p>
        Components are the building blocks of the Nestor system, and as the Nestor
        Admin you will have the ability to install, disable or even delete
        components from a standard set that ships with the core system. Active
        components are available to add to a
        <a href="manage_recipes.htm">Recipe</a>, and deleted components will be removed entirely. You can even build your
        own components with any functionality you’d like to add.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Admin components are provided to help you manage your installation of
        Nestor. There is also a set of
        <a  href="standard_components.htm">Standard Components</a> installed with Nestor
        that you can use to add features to your site Pages, such as <a href="component_access.htm">Access Control</a>, <a href="component_login.htm">Login</a>, and 
        <a href="component_media">Media content</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Manage Components tool allows you to activate, disable and delete
        components, and is available on the Admin page.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Component categories
    </h2>
    <p>
        The component categories appear across the top of the Manage Components
        page. To explore the categories, click on a category to see it’s associated
        components. The site category loads by default.

    <h2>Delete a component</h2>
    <p><strong>Deleting components is not recommended</strong>
        – once deleted you will lose access to the component permanently as your
        source files will be deleted. You would need to re-load the source files to
        regain access to the component. If you are sure you want to delete it,
        follow these instructions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the component is active, disable it.</li>
      <li>In the disabled state, a component will a display a <strong>Delete</strong> button. Click this button to delete the component.</li>
    </ul>

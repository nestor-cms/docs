      <h1>What is Nestor?</h1>
      <p>The Nested Component Based Content Management System (aka “Nestor”) is versatile system designed to allow a Site manager to rapidly build web content with multiple levels of 
      access.  Nestor is based on the concept of combining Components into a nested structure referred to as a Recipe.   Each Component is responsible for a small task, such as access 
      control, and when nested with other Components in a Recipe allows for cascading features and access control at any layer of the structure.   Put simply, Nestor is versatile 
      content management system designed to support user generated content.   </p>
  
      <p>The core Nestor engine translates a Recipe into a page that end users can interact with based on the type and placement of Components in the Recipe.  This system provides a 
      framework onto which:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Administrators determine what components will be allowed in the environment</li>
        <li>Site managers define a pattern that determines what type of content can be added to a page and by whom</li>
        <li>Page builders add structural content to create the pages</li>
        <li>End users upload content to designated areas on the page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Visit the Media Recipe Example to see how a Recipe translates into a Page.</p>
  
    <p> Nestor also allows for the integration of custom styles, templates and scripts to further customize the experience.  </p>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <p> Nestor was originally built to host courses that allow early childhood educators to become more
           effective instructors and continue their professional growth.  These courses provide a powerful 
           learning experience with their ability to allow end users to upload images and video of their work
            performance and then receive feedback from experts in their field.  To achieve this, we needed a 
            system that would allow us discrete control over what types of content could be uploaded and who 
            could upload it.  We quickly realized that the flexible design of the system would be applicable to
             many other applications and decided to make it available as an open source framework.

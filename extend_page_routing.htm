      <a name="_Toc517175189">Page Request Routing</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
      There are a few things that are important to understand about how the page
      requests are routed by Nestor:
  </p>
  <p>
      · All calls into your Nestor installation are intercepted by the .htaccess
      file and routed to index.php if the requested path doesn’t specify an
      existing file or directory
  </p>
  <p>
      · Index.php sets a few values and then loads initiate.php, which drives the
      build process
  </p>
  <p>
      · If the requested path contains a URL value recognized by the system, the
      page will be built according to the Recipe with the designated URL (see
      <a
          href="https://uwnetid.sharepoint.com/sites/og_cultivate-learning-nestor/Shared%20Documents/Documentation/Nestor%20Documentation.docx#_Manage_Recipes_2"
      >
          Manage Recipes
      </a>
      section for more information)
  </p>
  <p>
  o The URL value is found in this pattern: <em>[my_servername]</em>/    <em>[my_nestor]</em>/<strong>URL</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
  § For example, in the path    <a href="http://localhost/vce/admin">http://localhost/vce/admin</a> -
      ‘admin’ is the URL value
  </p>
  <p>
      o You can also add a ‘~[component_id]’ to the path querystring to render a
      specific component. This must be a page level component, or you will not
      see a properly rendered page.
  </p>
  <p>
  § For example:    <a href="http://localhost/vce/~1">http://localhost/vce/~1</a> will load the
      recipe associated with the component with component_id of 1
  </p>
  <p>
      · If the requested URL is not recognized, or the request is not accompanied
      by the correct security handshake, the request is routed to the home page

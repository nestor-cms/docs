    <h1>Page Request Routing
  </h1>
  <p>
      There are a few things that are important to understand about how the page
      requests are routed by Nestor:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>All calls into your Nestor installation are intercepted by the .htaccess
        file and routed to index.php if the requested path doesn’t specify an
        existing file or directory.  Refer to the <a href="install-htaccess.htm">.htaccess configuration section</a> for more information about server re-redirect information.</li>
    <li>Index.php sets a few values and then loads initiate.php, which drives the <a href="extend_page_build.htm">Page
            Build process</a>.</li>
    <li>If the requested path contains a URL value recognized by the system, the
                page will be built according to the Recipe with the designated URL (see
                <a  href="manage_recipes.htm">Manage Recipes</a> section for more information)
        <ul>
            <li>The URL value is found in this pattern: [<span class="italic">my_servername</span>]/[<span class="italic">my_nestor</span>/<strong>URL</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>For example, in the path <a href="http://localhost/vce/admin">http://localhost/vce/admin</a> -
                    <strong>admin</strong> is the URL value
                  </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You can also add a ‘~[<span class="italic">component_id</span>]’ to the path querystring to render a specific component. This must be a page level component, or you will not see a properly rendered page.</li>
        <ul>
           <li>For example:    <a href="http://localhost/vce/~1">http://localhost/vce/~1</a> will load the
                      recipe associated with the component with component_id of 1
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If the requested URL/component ID is not recognized, or the request is not accompanied
              by the correct security handshake, the request is routed to the home page.
    </li>
  </ul>

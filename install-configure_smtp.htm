    <h1>History</h1>
    <p> Nestor was originally built to host courses that allow early childhood educators to become more
       effective instructors and continue their professional growth.  These courses provide a powerful 
       learning experience with their ability to allow end users to upload images and video of their work
        performance and then receive feedback from experts in their field.  To achieve this, we needed a 
        system that would allow us discrete control over what types of content could be uploaded and who 
        could upload it.  We quickly realized that the flexible design of the system would be applicable to
         many other applications and decided to make it available as an open source framework.   </p>

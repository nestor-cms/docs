<h1>Manage Menus</h1>
<p>
    There are a few different navigational elements in the Nestor system. There
    is a default Main menu and Breadcrumbs menu that are set up in the standard
    Nestor install. The placement of the menus is laid out in the theme.php
    file associated with the install. The main menu is built automatically, but
    the Breadcrumbs menu is a component that can be deactivated.
</p>
<p>Learn more about how to display a menu on a page in the
    <a href="extend_templates.htm">Templates section</a>.
</p>
<h2>Main menu</h2>
<p>
    The main menu is on the top right hand side of the page. The out-of-the-box
    menu has options for Admin, Logout and My Account.
</p>

    />
</p>
<div class="screen_clip">Main Menu</div>
<p>
    You will have to be logged in to see all of the menu options, and you have
    to have the right level of access for some of them. For example, only a
    user with the role of Admin can see the Admin menu item.
</p>
<h2>Breadcrumbs menu</h2>
<p>
    One of the Components that is included with Nestor allows for a breadcrumbs
    menu to be added to your site. Within the default theme, code has been
    included to display a breadcrumbs menu on the top left. This menu displays
    the path that you’ve navigated to get to the current page. You can click
    any level in this menu to move back in the hierarchy.

<h2>
    Update the existing menu
</h2>
<p>
    A standard menu is setup during the Nestor installation that contains some
    basic elements. You can easily add your own pages to this menu, change the
    order of the menu items, or remove items.

      The heart of Nestor is the ability to build nested Recipes. Recipes
      describe the potential for what a page can look like – what elements can be
      added, where and by whom? Different components can be added to Recipes to
      provide different functionality. One component may provide navigational
      information, while another adds a layer of access control to the components
      that follow it. Adding certain components allows you to designate what type
      of content can be added by end users and in what ways end users can
      interact with content (add, update, delete etc). A recipe is like DNA in
      that it describes a template from which a page can be built.
  </p>
  <p> The Recipe is used during the
      <a href="page_build_process.htm">Page Build Process</a> to render the final page.
  </p>
  <p>The Manage Recipes interface consists of <strong>Components</strong>, <strong>Categories</strong> and the <strong>Recipe Build Area</strong>, as
      well as a field to name the Recipe and the <strong>Save</strong> button.
      The following sections describe how to use these features to build, edit
      and delete Recipes.

  <h2 id="nest">Why Nest?</h2>
  <p>
      The ability to nest components is the key to the power of Nestor. Any
      component that is nested within another component inherits the
      functionality of its parent component(s), which can create a very flexible
      system of cascading permissions and features.
  </p>
  <p> For example, the
      <a href="component_login.htm">Login</a> 
      component provides the functionality to allow a user to login. Any Recipe
      with Login in the top hierarchy will always check that a user has a valid
      login when the page is being rendered, and provide them with a login page
      if they aren’t logged in.
  </p>
  <p>
      Another great example is the <a href="component_access.htm">Access</a>
      component, which allows you to assign permissions to user roles. This
      component can be added at multiple levels in a Recipe. This would allow you
      to assign a role one level of permissions to one set of components, and
      then limit them to more restrictive permission level on other components on
      the same page.

  <h2 id="create_recipe">Create a New Recipe</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Navigate to the <strong>Admin</strong> page and select    <strong>Manage Recipes</strong></li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Create a New Recipe</strong> bar at the top of the
      page</li>
    <li>Active components are listed on the left, under the Components header</li>
    <li>Click on a <strong>Category</strong> at the bottom of the listed
      components to see all of the components associated with that category</li>
    <li>Click on a <strong>Component</strong> and drag it to the <strong>Recipe Build Area</strong>. This area is where you’ll assemble your
        Recipe.</li>
    <li>It’s important to understand that the first component in a Recipe will
      be the anchor for the rest of the components. Certain components are a
      better choice for this position, and choosing a less suitable component can
      be problematic for the function of your final page. Choose one of the ( <em>colored, highlighted or listed in another section</em>) components as
      the first component for the best experience. Refer to the <a
      href="standard_components">Standard Components</a> section for more information.</li>
      <li>Click and drag other components to the Recipe build area. You can drop
        them before or after existing components. When you drag a new component
        over one that’s in the Recipe, you’ll notice a white box that appears
        before or after the existing component. This indicates where the new
        component will be placed when you release it.

            <div class="screen_clip"> White box above Login component, Location will be placed above Login</div>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Components can be moved within the Recipe after they have been placed.
        Click on a component, then drag and drop to its new location.</li>
        <li>To nest components, drag the component to be nested over an existing
          Recipe component, and then slowly drag it to the right until you see a
          nested spot open up under the existing component. Release the new component
          and it should snap into this slot.

    Installation
</h2>
<br>
<p class="bold">I can't run the installer
</p>
<p>Make sure you have the entire LAMP/WAMP stack installed, and that all
    services are running
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Apache web server</li>
    <li>MySQL database service</li>
    <li>PHP interpreter</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p class="bold">I am running the installer on a Mac and see an error that the mcrypt
    file is missing
</p>
<p>This seems to be a problem with php 7.2, try running php 7.1.
</p>
<br>
<p class="bold">
   I see errors related to the MySQL database
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make sure the database account you entered during the installation has
            the correct level of permission to write to your database.</li>
    <li>Did you create a database in MySQL and enter the correct name for this
            database during the installation process?</li>
</ul> <br>

<p class="bold">I need to do a clean install</p>
<p>Run the installer again: look for the vce-installer.php file in the root
    of your installation folder and open it in a web browser, and either use
    the database you created for the last installation or create a new database
</p>
<br>
<p class="bold">
   I see an error about the mailserver
</p>
<p class="codified">
    Failed to connect to mailserver at &amp;quot;localhost&amp;quot; port 25,
</p>
<p>This message is a warning, and not a fatal error. Your installation will
    still work if you don't set up a mail server
</p>
<br>
<p class="bold">
   I see an error regarding a non-existant property
</p>
<p class="codified">
    Call to non-existant property $site-&gt;site_description()
</p>
<p>Check the site_meta table in the database and make sure there is a record
    with the following properties:
<ul>
    <li>meta_key = site_description</li>
    <li>meta_value = [<span class="italic">your site description</span>]</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't see this record, add it.
</p>
<p class="bold">
   My site isn't loading styles
</p>
<p>Check the site_meta table and make sure the record with meta_key = site_url has the correct value for the site path you use to access your
Nestor installation. Ie http://localhost/nestor.
</p>
<br>
<p class="bold">I see the message </p>
<p class="codified">"Forbidden" and "You don't have permission to access [<span class="italic">path</span>] on this server"
</p>
<p>Check that your path values were written correctly into the .htaccess
    file. For example:
</p>
<p class="codified">
    # BEGIN<br>
    &lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;<br>
    RewriteEngine On<br>
    RewriteBase /VCE/<br>
    RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]<br>
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f<br>
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d<br>
    RewriteRule . /VCE/index.php [L]<br>
    RedirectMatch 301 /VCE/vce-content/uploads/(.*) /VCE/<br>
    &lt;/IfModule&gt;<br>
    # END
</p>
<p class="bold">
   I see an internal server error
</p>
<p>Syntax errors in the htaccess file will cause an internal server error.
    Make sure all your syntax is correct.
</p>
<br>
<p class="bold">
   My re-directs don't seem to be working correctly
</p>
<p>The AllowOverride directive in the Apache httpd.conf may be set to
    "none", which basically prevents the .htaccess file from doing
    anything. Set this to "all".
</p>
<p>Correct directive syntax:
</p>
<p class="codified">
    AllowOverride all
</p>

<h2 id="file_uploads">
    File Uploads
</h2>
<br>
<p class="bold"> My end users are not able to upload files.
</p>
<p>When installing in a dedicated server environment, the file permission
    for "vce-content/uploads" must be set to 775. If you have shell access,
    from within the "vce-content" directory, execute the following shell
    command: <a name="_Configure_(IT/Web_Manager)"></a>sudo chmod -R 775
    uploads
</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2 id="mySQL">
    MySQL errors
</h2>
<p>
   When I call a method that inserts data into the database, I'm
    seeing errors regarding incorrect datatype values. For example:
</p>
<p class="codified">
    Error: Incorrect integer value: '' for column 'component_id' at row 1
</p>
<p>This can be a common issue using the Windows environment, which uses the
    WAMP stack. WAMP sets the MySQL mode to "strict" by default,
    which means that you generally can't insert null values into a
    database field set for other types of data. You can either make sure to
    provide '0' values for any numeric data expected, or set your
    sql_mode to 'none'. This can mask other issues, so you may want
    to consider the best strategy to handle this situation.
</p>
<p>To set MySQL sql_mode to 'none':
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click on the WAMP icon in your desktray, then hover over these settings Mysql -&gt; MySQL settings -&gt; sql-mode</li>
    <li>In the sql_mode window, select sql-mode-&gt;none
            <p>
                <img
                        border="0"
                        width="256"

                />
            </p>
    </li>
    
</ol>

<p class="bold">I don't see the component I want to add

<ol>
    <li>Visit the <a href="manage_components.htm">Manage Components page</a> and make sure your component is
            installed and activated</li>
    <li>Click through the categories under the components and see if the component is listed under a different category</li>

</ol>
<br>
<p class="bold">I don't see the categories under the components

<br>
<p class="bold">I can't get the components to nest
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Make sure the component you want to nest is on top of the parent component, and the parent component recognizes it. You'll see a subtle color change in the gray menu box of the parent component when it's in this state.

   <li>Once you see the color change, slowly drag the child component to the
    right until you see the gray menu box of the parent stretch to the next row
    and open up a nested position for the new child.

</ol>
<br>
<p class="bold">I created and saved a Recipe, and now I can't move or even remove
        the components.
</p>
<p>There are certain components that lock into place once you've added them to a Recipe, including <a href="components_login.htm">Login</a> and <a href="components_location.htm">Location</a>.
<p>
    If you have a recipe using these components and need to change the Recipe,

    Make sure the Role Hierarchy is not set to 0. If set to 0, the Role does
    not show up in the drop-down for a new user. (As far as I can tell by
    testing to verify this is not true &#8211; as in, it works fine for me)

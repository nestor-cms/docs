  <h1>.htaccess file settings</h1>  

<p>
    All calls into your Nestor installation are intercepted by the .htaccess
    file and routed to index.php if the path doesn’t specify an existing file
    or directory. Settings in the .htaccess file route the requests. You
    shouldn’t have to change this file, as the Nestor Installer should write
    the correct settings.
</p>
<p>
    RewriteBase /<em>{your basepath}</em>/
</p>
<p>
    · Designates scope of rewrite to any requests made to this path
</p>
<p>
    · Make sure this path matches the root directory of your installation. For
    example, if you used <strong>http://localhost/mynestor</strong> to navigate
to your installation, then this basepath value would be    <strong>/mynestor/</strong>
</p>
<p>
    ^index\.php$ - [L]
</p>
<p>
    · prevents requests for index.php from being rewritten, to avoid an
    unnecessary file system check. If the request is for index.php the
    directive does nothing - and stops processing rules [L].
</p>
<p>
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
</p>
<p>
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
</p>
<p>
    RewriteRule . /vce/index.php [L]
</p>
<p>
    · This block is all one rule, and it says that if it is not an existing
    file or directory, reroute the request to index.php.
